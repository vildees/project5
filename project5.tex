\section*{$N$-body simulation of an open galactic cluster}

\subsection*{Introduction}

Throughout this project we will develop a code to perform simulations of an open cluster using Newtonian gravity. We will consider the evolution by following the motion of its constituent stars. This interacting classical system require integrating Newton's equation of motion over a long period of time starting from some initial conditions. This type of simulations are called "N-body" simulations. 

First we will compare the stability of two different methods for solving differential equations; the fourth order Runge-Kutta and the Leap-Frog method. When we are looking at a system with a large number of particles we are more interested in the statistical properties than the individual motion of each of the particles. This means that the stability of the solution method is more important than its short term accuracy.

First we implement the Newtonian two-body problem in three-dimensions. We choose to look at a hypothetical solar system, with only one planet, the Earth, orbiting the Sun. We will check the stability of the two numerical methods for different time steps and time scales. 

Thereafter we will adapt our code to simulate a simple model of how an open cluster is made from the gravitational collapse and interaction among a large number of stars. In this simulation we will assume what is called a "cold collapse", that is that the particles starts with little or no initial velocity. We will rewrite the code so that it works for an arbitrary number of particles. We will start with a uniform (random) distribution within a sphere of a given radius $R_0$. The masses of the particles will be randomly distributed by a Gaussian distribution around ten solar masses with a standard deviation of one solar mass. From our simulations we will extract information about the systems energies. We will look at energy conservation and ejected particles and their associated energies for a different number of particles $N$. 
To take care of the numerical instability that arises when the particles come very close, we will insert a smoothing function.     


\subsection*{Theory}

The only force in this problem is gravity, given by Newton's law of gravitation. The force between two objects with masses $M_1$ and $M_2$ is 

\[
F = \frac{GM_1 M_2}/{r^2}
\]

where $r$ is the distance between them and $G$ the gravitational constant. 

In one dimension Newton's second law yields this second-order differential equation

$$m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = F(x,t)$$

We can rewrite the second-order ordinary differential equation as a set of coupled first order differential equations. 
We know that the velocity and the acceleration is connected to the position by the time derivative so that

\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = v(x,t) \hspace{1cm}\mathrm{and}\hspace{1cm}
\frac{dv_x}{dt} = \frac{F(x,t)}{M} = a(x,t)
\]

Performing a Taylor expansion we get 
\[
x(t+h) = x(t) + hx^{(1)} + \frac{h^2}{2}x^{(2)}(t) + O(h^3)
\]

To calculate the next time step of the system we will use to methods for numerically integrating differential equations; the Runga-Kutta method and the Leap-Frog method.

When implementing these methods for the Newtonian two-body system, I chose to look at the Earth-Sun system. I chose the initial conditions such that the orbit of the Earth should be circular.

For circular motion we know that the force must obey the following relation 
$$\frac{M_{Earth}v^2}{r} = F_G = \frac{GM_{sun}M_{Earth}}{r^2}$$ where $v$ is the velocity of the Earth. 
For circular orbit the velocity of the Earth is $v = \frac{2 \pi r}{1 year}$, where the distance between Sun and Earth is $r = 1 AU$. Hence $v = 2 \pi (AU/years)$. Rearranging the equation we find
$$v^2r = GM_{sun} = 4 \pi ^2 AU^3/years^2$$

For circular motion the velocity will be tangential. It follows that if we choose the initial conditions $ x = 1 AU $ and $ y = 0$, with velocities $v_x = 0$ and $v_y = v_{tangential} = 2 \pi AU/year$ we will get a circular orbit.    

The next task in the project was to build a model of an open cluster. An open cluster is a group up to a few thousand gravitationally bound stars created from the collapse of a molecular cloud. In our model we will work with a few hundred particles. We will simulate what is called a "cold collapse", which means that we start the particles with no initial velocity. 

In a system like this the evolution of the system leads to a singularity after a finite time as $N -> \inf$, since all the mass arrives at the origin after a time $\tau_{crunch}$. The time of the collapse is given by $$\tau_{crunch} = \sqrt{\frac{3 \pi}{32G \rho_0}},$$ where $\rho_0$ is the initial mass density. 

Our numerical simulation has a finite number of particles $N$, and thus the singularity does not occur. Even if we had the ability to make the simulation for an infinite number of particles, we have approximated the objects as point particles. In the limit where $N -> \inf$, and keeping $\rho$ constant, we should get a continuous fluid. However, looking at the particles as point particles, we will not get the uniformly distributed "lump" of mass which leads to the system collapse into a singularity.     

Using $\tau_{crunch}$ as an unit of time, we can find $G$ in these units. 

\[
\tau_{crunch} = \sqrt{\frac{3 \pi}{32 G \rho_0}} = 1
\]

which gives 

\[
\frac{3 \pi}{32G \rho_0} = 1 \hspace{1mm} \Rightarrow \hspace{1mm} G = \frac{3 \pi}{32 \rho_0}
\]

We have that 
\[
\rho_0 = \frac{\Sigma M}{V} = \frac{\mu N}{ \frac{4}{3} \pi R_0^3} 
\]

We thus have
\[
G = \frac{3 \pi}{32} \frac{4 \pi R_0^3}{3 \mu N} = \frac{\pi^2 R_0^ 3}{8 \mu N}
\]


SMOOTHING FUNC
When two of the particles come very close, a time step that is reasonable for larger distances is far too large to calculate the trajectories. When the particles have close encounters, we will get very large acceleration and thus the necessity for very small time steps. To take care of this numerical instability we introduce a smoothing function. We will modify the Newtonian force law to make it finite at short ranges
\[
F_{mod} = - \frac{GM_1M_2}{r^2 + \epsilon^2}
\]

The parameter $\epsilon$ is a small real constant which we set to be $\epsilon = 0.15 ly$. We can justify the correction to the pure Newtonian force by noting that our particles do not represent actual point particles but rather mass distribution of some finite extent. 

With this modified force the code does not integrate accurately trajectories in which particles have close encounters, but on a macroscopic scale this trajectories does not play a significant role.  
  
\subsection*{Method}

Both the Runge-Kutta and the Leap-Frog solver are methods that advances the solution from $x(t)$ to $x(t+h) = x(t) + hv(t)$ where $h$ is the step length to the new point we are calculating. The step is defined by splitting an interval of size $N$ in to sub-intervals $h = \frac{b-a}{N}$. With this step and the derivative of $x$ we can construct the next value of the function. 

If we were only to use the derivative at the beginning of each interval when calculating the next step, as in Euler's method, the error in each calculation will be in the power $O(\Delta t^2)$. The Runge-Kutta method improves the approximation by using trial steps within each interval to make a better estimate of the derivative. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method requires four evaluations in each interval $\Delta t$, and thus reduces the error to the power $O(\Delta t^5$.  

 
\subsubsection*{The Runge-Kutta method}

The Runge-Kutta solver is a method for solving ordinary differential equations for which we know the initial values. In this project the motion of the planets are described by a second-order differential equation of the position as a function of time. We want to find the propagation of this function forward in time starting from the given initial values. 

Taylor series expansion of a function $x$ around $t$ gives
$$ x(t+ \Delta t) = x(t) + \frac{dx}{dt} \Delta t + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{d^2 x}{d^2 t} (\Delta t)^2 + \cdots $$

If we assume a reasonable smooth function $x(t)$ and a small interval $\Delta t$ we can approximate $x(t)$ to $x(t + \Delta t)$ as long as we know the derivatives of $x(t)$. 

In a general Runge-Kutta method we approximate the slope by different function evaluations with different weights.

When using the Runge-Kutta four approximation one estimates the slopes at four points, once at the initial point, twice at the trial midpoint and once at the trial endpoint. 
$$ k_1 = \Delta t f(t_i,x_i) \\
k_2 = \Delta t f(t_i + \Delta t /2, x_i + k_1/2) \\
k_3 = \Delta t f(t_i + \Delta t/2, x_i + k_2/2) \\
k_4 = \Delta t f(t_i + \Delta t, x_i + k3) $$

These four derivatives constitute the next value in our propagation
$$x_{i+1} = x_i + \frac{1}{6} (k_1 + 2(k_2+k_3) + k_4$$

    vec k1, k2, k3, k4;
    vec C = zeros(values*n);
 
    for(int i=0; i<N; i++) {

        Solver::SolveSystem(A);	 // Calculates the time derivatives 											of A 
        k1 = dAdt;				
        C = A + k1*(dt/2);		 // Updates A in a "temporary"

        }
    }
}
\end{lstlisting} 

\subsubsection*{The Leap-Frog method}

The Leap-Frog scheme uses another approach to reach the best approximation. In the first step you use the initial conditions to calculate the velocity at the middle of the interval.
$$ v(t + h/2) = v(t) + \frac{h}{2} a(t). $$
Then you use this value to calculate the new position 
$$x(t+h) = x(t) + hv(t + h/2).$$
Finally you calculate the velocity at the end of the interval 
$$v(t+h) = v(t+h/2) + \frac{h}{2} a(t+h).$$   

 \begin{lstlisting}[title={Function Leap Frog}]
void Solver::LeapFrog() {

    double x, y, z, vx, vy, vz, ax, ay, az, ax_new, ay_new, az_new;

    vec vx_new(n);

    for(int j=0; j<N; j++) {

        Solver::SolveSystem(A);

        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {

            int vi = values*i;

            x = A(vi);
            y = A(vi+1);
            z = A(vi+2);

            vx = dAdt(vi);
            vy = dAdt(vi+1);
            vz = dAdt(vi+2);

            ax = dAdt(vi+3);                        // ax(t)
            ay = dAdt(vi+4);                        // ay(t)
            az = dAdt(vi+5);                        // az(t)

            vx_new(i) =  vx + (dt/2)*ax;            // vx(t+dt/2)
            vy_new(i) =  vy + (dt/2)*ay;            // vy(t+dt/2)
            vz_new(i) =  vz + (dt/2)*az;            // vz(t+dt/2)

            A(vi)   = x + dt*vx_new(i);             // x(t+dt)
            A(vi+1) = y + dt*vy_new(i);             // y(t+dt)
            A(vi+2) = z + dt*vz_new(i);             // z(t+dt)
        }

        Solver::SolveSystem(A);

        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {

            int vi = values*i;

            ax_new = dAdt(vi+3);                   // ax(t+dt)
            ay_new = dAdt(vi+4);                   // ay(t+dt)
            az_new = dAdt(vi+5);                   // az(t+dt)

            A(vi+3) = vx_new(i) + (dt/2)*ax_new;    // vx(t+h)
            A(vi+4) = vy_new(i) + (dt/2)*ay_new;    // vy(t+h)
            A(vi+5) = vz_new(i) + (dt/2)*az_new;    // vz(t+h)
        }
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Implementing the methods}
In my program I have two external classes; one that holds the values of various constants, like the gravitational constant, the masses of the different objects and so on, and one class "Planet". The latter creates an instance when called upon that contains information of the initial position and velocity and the mass corresponding to the object. For instance, 

\begin{lstlisting}[title={Making of instance}]
planet Earth = planet(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.*pi, 0.0, M_earth);
\end{lstlisting} 

makes an instance Earth that contains the initial $x, y, z$ - positions and $v_x, v_y, v_z$ - velocities and the mass of the Earth.

I then create a vector $A$ that contains the initial positions, $(x,y,z)$, and the velocities, $(v_x,v_y,v_z)$, for all objects.

\[ A = \left( \begin{array}{c}
x - object \hspace*{0.5mm} 1\\
y - object \hspace*{0.5mm} 1\\
z - object \hspace*{0.5mm} 1 \\
vx - object \hspace*{0.5mm} 1\\
vy -object \hspace*{0.5mm}  1\\
vz - object \hspace*{0.5mm} 1 \\
x - object \hspace*{0.5mm} 2\\
... \\
vz - object \hspace*{0.5mm} n \end{array} \right)\]    

I have a function that finds the time derivative of these values, $dAdt$. The time derivative of the position is simply the velocity, and that value is already saved in $A$ and easy to obtain. To find the acceleration, that is the time derivative of the velocities, I use Newtons second law. For each planet we then sum over the gravitational forces working on it from all the other objects, and thus find the acceleration. 

To calculate the time propagation of the objects, I use the Runge-Kutta and the Leap-Frog methods discussed above. Both calculating the propagation forward in time starting from the given initial conditions. 

My program is built in such a way that the function calculating the derivatives, the Runge-Kutta and the Leap-Frog solver works for different lengths of the vector $A$. Thus to change my program from the two-body system to the $N$-body system it is only the initial value of $A$ that needs changing.

For the two-body system the initial conditions is quite straight forward

 \begin{lstlisting}[title={Initial conditions two-body system}]
 vec A = zeros(values*n);
 vec dAdt = zeros(values*n);
 vec M = zeros(n);

 planet Earth = planet(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.*pi, 0.0, M_earth);
 planet Sun = planet(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, M_sun);
 planet B[n];

 B[0] = Earth;
 B[1] = Sun;

  // initial conditions

  for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
        int j = values*i;		// values = 2*dimensionality
       
        A(j)   = B[i].x0;                     // x - position
        A(j+1) = B[i].y0;                     // y - position
        A(j+2) = B[i].z0;                     // z - position
        A(j+3) = B[i].vx;                     // vx - velocity
        A(j+4) = B[i].vy;                     // vy - velocity
        A(j+5) = B[i].vz;                     // vz - velocity

        M(i)   = B[i].M;
        
    }
 
 \end{lstlisting}
 
 
For the $N$-body system, however, the initial conditions are a bit more challenging. We wish to place our $N$ particles in a uniform, random distribution within a sphere of radius $R_0$. The initial velocities are easy. We will simulate what is called a "cold collapse", and start our particles with no initial velocity. The particles should be randomly distributed by a Gaussian distribution around ten solar masses with a standard deviation of one solar mass.  


\subsubsection*{Uniformly distributed random coordinates within a sphere and randomly distributed mass}

To find the coordinates of the particles I used the function $ran2$ that was available from the web page. It yields a random number between 0 and 1 when called upon with a negative seed. For our purpose we wish to convert these numbers into coordinates of uniformly distributed particles within a sphere of radius $R_0$. 

To do this one can use spherical coordinates
\begin{align}
x = r sin \theta cos \phi \\
y = r sin \theta sin \phi \\
z = r cos \theta
\end{align}

where $ \theta \hspace{0.5mm} \epsilon \hspace{0.5mm} [0, \pi], \phi \hspace{0.5mm} \epsilon \hspace{0.5mm} [0, 2\pi], r \hspace{0.5mm} \epsilon \hspace{0.5mm} [0, R_0]$. 
 
We then use the fact that the volume element should be the same for any coordinate system. We introduce three new variables with a uniform distribution between 0 and 1, and write the volume element in terms of these coordinates. We get
\[
r^2 sin \theta dr d \theta d \phi = Adudvdw
\]

where $A$ is just a constant and $u, v, w \hspace{0.5mm} \epsilon \hspace{0.5mm} [0,1]$. When separating the variables we get three equations   

\[
r^2dr = adu \hspace{1cm}\mathrm{,}\hspace{1cm}
sin \theta = bdv \hspace{1cm}\mathrm{,}\hspace{1cm}
d \phi = cdw
\]

Integrating up we find that
\[
\phi = 2 \pi w  \hspace{1cm}\mathrm{and}\hspace{1cm}
r = R_0 \sqrt[3]{u}  \hspace{1cm}\mathrm{and}\hspace{1cm}
   \theta = arccos(1-2v) 
\]

After calculating these values it is easy to transform back to $(x,y,z)$-coordinates using the expressions for the spherical coordinates.


The mass of the objects should be randomly distributed by a Gaussian distribution around ten solar masses with a standard deviation of a solar mass. I used the function $gaussian_deviate$, which has a standard deviation $ \sigma = 1$ and is centered around zero. To get our wanted distribution we thus must calculate the masses   
$$ M = \sigma gaussian_deviate() + \mu $$
where $\sigma = 1$ and $\mu = 10$.

\subsection*{Results}

When running our program for the two-body system of the Earth and the Sun I choose initial values so that the trajectory should be circular. Running our program I found that both the Runge-Kutta method and the Leap-Frog method gives trajectories that lives up to our expectations. See figure..

\begin{figure}

        \end{subfigure}
        \caption{Motion of the Earth orbiting the Sun calculated for two years with a time step $\Delta t = 0.002$}
    
\end{figure}

However, when running for different time steps we found that our algorithm highly depends on the choice of step. The program will not yield the wanted result if we do not choose the right time step. From the figures we see that time step $\Delta t = 0.002$ gives the wanted trajectory for both methods, while a time step of the size $\Delta t = 0.1$ is unstable for both methods. 

From the figures we see that the Leap-Frog method is less vulnerable to the wrong choice of time step than the Runge-Kutta solver. We see that for $\Delta t = 0.1$ the Runge-Kutta method gives a solution where the Earth starts spiraling inwards to the Sun. (Non-adaptive method). As the Earth gets too close to the Sun, a time step that was reasonable for more distant objects is far to large when we get close to the Sun. And thus we get the effect we see from figure..., the Earth escapes from the Sun's  gravitational field. 

I made a program that runned over different dt values, and picked out the largest radius for each kjøring. 

From figure ... we see the maximal radius in the orbit for different choice of $\Delta t$. 
This radius should be constant at $1 AU$, as it is for the small time steps for both methods. It is easy to see from figures ... that the Leap-Frog method tolerates a larger time step than the Runge-Kutta method before it gets unstable.

$$For plot av Cluster RK4 med t_f = 2 og n = 1000 --> fin animasjon av hvordan partiklene "forsvinner" når vi ikke bruker en smoothing funksjon. Samme som vi fant i prosjekt 3 når vi hadde for stort tidsteg. Partiklene kom for nære hverandre og fikk veldig stor energi --> sendt ut av gravitasjonsfeltet.   
$$

We can use the same idea in a simple, elegant method for integrating
Newton’s laws of motion, which takes advantage of the property that the equation for dx/dt does not involve x itself and the equation for
dv/dt (v is the velocity) does not involve v (assuming velocity independent forces). More precisely,for a single degree of freedom, the equations of motion are


\subsection*{Radial density}
Look at the total energy for each object at a time t. Looping over the energies we pick put the objects that has a negative total energy and thus are bound. Using the mass and position of these particles we then calculate the center of mass. I then write the radius relative to the center of mass to a file.   

We have a maximal radius the objects must be within. Divide up to many radius, and find out how many particles is in each "shell" out towards the outer shell. The density of each shell is the number of particles divided by the volume of the shell. (Volume of the sphere minus volume of the inner sphere).

\subsection*{conclusion}

If you have postitive energy the the system is unbound and the planet will escape. If we have negative energy-- 

For the non-adaptive methods: getting too close to the sun: a timestep that was reasonable for more distant object is far to large if you're close to the sun. The effect we saw --> escape
